# CarRentalProject 

CarRental Project by RobMac 

This project involves use of project management: GIT, databases: MySQL, programming fundamentals: Java, API development: SpringBoot and automated testing: JUnit and Mockito.  The below and attached details the CarRental System back end-end system, for simplification at this stage it is split into booking and car tables.  It uses Java Spring Boot and it could be linked to front end.  It has various CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities to maintain the system and keep it updated. It is split into two tables. A table for bookings and a table for vehicles/cars. This system is designed for companies to make it more convenient for them store, update and maintain booking and vehicle data. This README is an overview of the project. 

Features: 

Booking: 

*view uniquebookingnumber 

*view bookingdate 

*view vehicletype 

*view carnumber 

*update booking 

*delete booking 

*update bookingstatus 

*update numberofdays 

 

Cars: add view update delete 

* view carstatus 

*update carstatus 

*view model 

*view carnumber 

*view cardatepurchased 

*view carlocation 

  

Project Structure: 

* Attached is an outline of the project structure: 

  

Database: 

* An ERD diagram is made for the database table 

* The tables can be linked together through the carnumber primary key. 

 

Execution using Postman - CRUD: 

  

  

Using Spring Boot, key points: 

*It is important to run the application as springboot and check there are no errors at start. 

*Port 8080 should be used  

*Checking the tomcat is running should indicate whether the application is successful to start and run. 

  

Testing: this was done using mockito-JUnit. 

  

My learning so far:  time was limited for this project, so I would have liked some more time to expand on the ideas and get some one-to-one advice from the teacher.  I am grateful for the help I received.  I have learned a lot more about grammar errors, instructional/coding errors in java.   Now I know the importance and significance of using data types in java, how to find errors from the consoles output and how to make sure input data of service corresponds to controller and repository.
